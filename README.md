# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project

**INTRO**
Nowadays online transactions have become an important and necessary part of our lives.  It is vital that credit card companies are able to identify fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Using a dataset of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. 

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
I have used the Jupyter  Notebook  platform  to  make  a  program  in  Python  to demonstrate the approach. Python. Numpy and Pandas are used for simplified tasks like the storing and manipulation of data. Matplotlib is used for the interpretation and visualisation of results. Seaborn is used for the analysis of statistical information and we used Scikit Learn for algorithms. 

**Real World Applications:**
Credit card fraud detection system has a great application in the financial sector. Credit card fraud costs consumers and the financial company billions of dollars annually, and fraudsters continuously try to find new rules and tactics to commit illegal actions. Thus, fraud detection systems have become essential for banks and financial institutions, to minimize their losses.

**Challenges Faced:**
Our model will not perform well if the training set is too small, or if the data is not generalized, noisy, and corrupted with irrelevant features.

**Future Working:** Our future working will be with Neural Networks for efficient finding of fraud when deployed in any financial institution server.
